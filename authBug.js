The Firebase Authentication SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger immediately after a successful sign-in or sign-out, leading to unexpected UI behavior or data inconsistencies.  This is often due to asynchronous operations and timing issues. For example, a user signs in, but a component trying to access their UID immediately afterward receives `null` because the state change hasn't fully propagated yet.
